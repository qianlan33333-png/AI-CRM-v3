# Referral settings design QA

final result: blocked

Source: user /Users/qianlan/Downloads/1.png and retained CRM template reference.
Implementation: http://127.0.0.1:4189/admin/referral/settings, actual webshell renderer and built Referral assets with read-only local API fixtures. Chrome native UI inspected on 2026-09-19. Screenshot /tmp/referral-settings-preview.png.

Fixed during visual verification: settings failed to mount because shared product selector script was not loaded; large participation dropdown stretched to adjacent picker height; form controls moved out of page header. Re-capture confirms complete-page route, persistent CRM navigation, four white setting sections, blue numbered headings, page-header actions and non-stretched product controls.

Source and implementation were emitted together for comparison twice. Current desktop viewport is 1051x768 including browser chrome, source is 1487x1058. Exact viewport/state comparison and mobile verification remain open, so full design QA is not marked passed. Existing cover URL field is retained; image upload, radio/switch styling and chosen-product thumbnail do not yet reproduce the reference. Do not report pixel fidelity or full Product Design completion.

Functional evidence: PostgreSQL and JSDOM tests are recorded in the PRD. Local visual fixtures are not production readback or purchase acceptance.
