# Audience existing-WeCom proof derivation

OneID: Resolve existing canonical roots only; no Provision, linking, merge, or UnionID assurance upgrade. Persistence: offline encrypted derivation, then Segment Owner static historical import under one UoW. No jobs/Provider calls and no source SQL execution.

Keep the original audience snapshot and capture timestamp, source namespace, row IDs and row digests unchanged. The offline `extract-frozen-wecom-proof.py` reads an exact SHA-confirmed authenticated commerce envelope and emits a protected version2 proof. Source UnionID is only an opaque directory lookup key. It requires confirmed Corp, numeric raw errcode0 and matching raw external-contact IDs. The shared Go helper also enforces active records, unique primary external relation, and matching raw provider evidence. Target Resolve must find an existing customer; missing/conflicting records remain quarantined.

Run the script with `--capture`, `--key`, `--expected-sha256`, `--corp-env`, `--output`, `--output-key`. Inputs/output must be0600. Do not print raw identities or input files. Then run `migrate-audience-history derive-existing-wecom --snapshot ORIGINAL --snapshot-key-file KEY --expected-sha256 ORIGINAL_SHA --identity-proof PROOF --identity-proof-key-file PROOF_KEY --proof-source-sha256 RAW_CIPHERTEXT_SHA --output-snapshot NEW_DERIVED`. The envelope binds original/proof/raw digests plus a separate derivation time, without changing source capture time or declarations.

Use the exact derived SHA for preflight, apply (`--confirm-static-import --admin-id ACTUAL_ADMIN`) and reconcile in the isolated database. Existing source package mappings are reused. This supports the first import of this capture; a later source snapshot must be newer under existing Owner CAS. Do not change the source namespace or capture timestamp to bypass conflicts.

Unresolved members remain in the ledger; exited rows are excluded from active snapshots. Packages remain paused/static, with old dynamic SQL retained only as evidence. Static import does not recreate dynamic audience rules.
