# Open platform behavior contract

## Classification

```text
OneID: resolves scoped external identity and reads canonical customer; never provisions, links, or merges.
Persistence: Access machine clients/grants/audit use one local PostgreSQL Unit of Work.
External Effects: no new effect writer. Every business command reaches its existing domain Port/UoW/River/EER path.
```

## Route inventory

`internal/openplatform/http/inventory.go` has the authoritative 56 `method + path + capability` records transcribed from the approved `03a-machine-route-inventory.md`. The HTTP mux registers every record explicitly; it does not open a prefix or an admin route by accident. A record is complete only after the composition executor maps it to an existing owner Port and its behavior test passes.

## Archive historical compatibility facts

- Donor chat reads used the archived row's `unionid` and its row/raw-payload `group_name`; neither is reconstructed from current Identity or a group directory.
- 0098 adds one Archive-owned row per retained message when the imported source contains either fact. Its `TEXT` columns are protected by Archive table ownership and the existing authorized Archive read boundary; they are not represented as field-level ciphertext. It carries no second message stream.
- `migrate-message-archive extract` reads donor `archived_messages` only in an explicit repeatable-read, read-only transaction, maps row `unionid` and row/raw-payload `group_name`; its actual SDK wrapper contributes only the validated `decrypted_message`, while the full protected wrapper contributes a SHA-256 source fact, then writes a `0600` offline manifest. Import includes those values and the wrapper digest in the source-row digest, receipt/replay comparison, target equivalence check, and reconcile path. A source conflict is quarantined; a stored projection mutation makes reconcile fail. Source rows without either field intentionally return empty fields.
- `migrate-survey-v2` already extracts donor `questionnaire_submissions.unionid` into its sealed source snapshot. 0099 preserves it only as a Survey-owned historical external-read projection, with an independent projection digest and replay/reconcile check. It never promotes a missing source scope into verified OneID evidence, does not resolve/provision/link a Customer, and deliberately has no projection row where the source value is absent.

## Security invariants

- Secrets are shown only in create/rotate responses, are stored as Argon2id hashes, and do not appear in summaries or audit details.
- `auth_version`, enabled state, expiry, audience, requested-scope subset, and source CIDR are checked against PostgreSQL on every machine request. A JWT signature alone is insufficient.
- The direct key only accepts the fixed readonly template. A machine principal has capabilities; it cannot become an Access `super_admin` or use a payload `operator` value as authority.
- Untrusted `X-Forwarded-*` headers are ignored. TLS is required unless the remote address belongs to an explicitly configured trusted-proxy CIDR and asserts HTTPS.
- Historical import receipts have no secret/token fields. A sealed source snapshot has its own batch identifier; the frozen donor revision is provenance only. Source records replay across batches only when their source scope, identity, and digest agree; drift is rejected. Local legacy customer-id scope is pending/excluded until trusted Identity evidence maps it, so reissue and activation cannot turn coincident numeric IDs into authorization. Non-verifiable source credentials are recorded `inactive` or `reissue_required`; they never become live credentials.

## 56-route implementation evidence

This matrix records the current executable state rather than treating a registered mux route as complete. At this checkpoint, four routes reach an owner Port with a real PostgreSQL journey (the Radar mapping still needs its final authenticated HTTP-combination fixture), four routes are only partially equivalent, and 48 routes remain unmigrated. `Not migrated` means the machine executor returns no business success for that route and it remains delivery work in this PR.
