# PR09 configuration slice

This package is PR09's bounded local-configuration implementation. It owns the
non-secret registry, PostgreSQL settings/receipt/audit/outbox tables, safe
admin projection, and the local setup-wizard CAS/readback behavior. Values
that are secret-bearing are represented only by configured/masked facts and
are rejected before persistence or event append.

The application layer depends only on v3 `platform/port` and these local
configuration ports. The v3 HTTP adapter exposes the frozen app-settings and
setup-wizard DTOs behind session, role, CSRF, route-bound action-token and
idempotency checks. It saves only local material facts: `external=false`,
`local_only=true`, and `runtime_applied=false`; it neither applies runtime
configuration nor calls a Provider. The PR10 host adapter mounts only the
verified donor fragments in the sole v3 admin shell.
