# Media migration preparation (PR02)

This package is the bounded PR02 Media capability, derived from a frozen
legacy donor. It contains Media-owned validation, PostgreSQL persistence,
opaque reference protection, compatibility HTTP routes, and
provider-independent image/attachment/card operations.

The package is registered only through the v3 composition root and uses the
single PostgreSQL UoW for resources, receipts, audit events, and outbox rows.
It imports neither the v2 module/runtime/database nor other domains' internal
layers. Provider calls remain disabled; content packages are owned by PR06 and
are not exposed by the PR02 routes.

## PR06 Media-owned content package closure

OneID decision: **not involved**. A content package names only Media records;
it neither accepts nor resolves customer or channel identities.

Persistence decision: **local transaction**. `0016_media_content_packages.sql`
adds Media-owned package/current-version/version-reference/binding/receipt
tables. Package state, idempotency receipt, Media audit and Media outbox are
committed in the same UoW. Each version reference records the actual source
digest observed while the enabled Media record is locked.

Group Ops receives only the stable `GroupOpsMaterialSourceCapturer` port. It
locks and captures enabled Media facts in the caller UoW; the existing freezer
still requires an actual Media preparation reader with provider-ready media
receipts before it can emit a send snapshot. This package does not manufacture
Provider media IDs, add a worker, call a Provider, or write Group Ops tables.

The exact v2 admin templates and their existing TypeScript/CSS/shared API
dependencies are staged under `web/donors/media-v2/`. They remain byte-exact
and are mounted only inside the v3 `admin_base` shell. Their source and
SHA-256 reconciliation are recorded in
`docs/migration/media/pr02-donor-manifest.yaml` and
`docs/migration/media/pr02-donor-sha256.txt`.
